## Overview
Pyploto is a social media application that was designed for peers to interact and share their music tastes. Majority of other popular social media apps are not specific with what content people post, so there is a large amount of filler posts that do not pertain to music. 
The original goal of Pyploto was to have identical functionality as Instagram, but be a platform dedicated to the idea of discovery music. The main feature of the application is a feed that allows a user to post an image related to the music they want to share. In order to embody the idea of music discovery, posts are global so that everyone can see what everyone else posts. This allows for exposure of all kinds and does not restrict someone's profile to only see what their social circle is listening to.
